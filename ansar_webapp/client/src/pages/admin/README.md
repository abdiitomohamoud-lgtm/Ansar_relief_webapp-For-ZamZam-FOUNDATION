# Admin Pages

This folder contains all main admin dashboard pages:

- `Dashboard.js`/`DashboardOverview.js`: Analytics and overview.
- `Users.js`: User management (CRUD, roles, logs).
- `Content.js`: Campaigns, products, articles management.
- `Messages.js`: User messages and feedback.
- `Settings.js`: Site and user preferences.
- `index.js`: Main admin router and layout.

Each page is modular and fetches data from the backend using secure, role-based APIs.

## Extending

Add new pages for additional admin features as needed. Use the existing structure for consistency and maintainability.
