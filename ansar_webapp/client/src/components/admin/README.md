# Admin Components

This folder contains all modular, reusable components for the Admin Dashboard. Each component is designed for dynamic data, accessibility, and mobile responsiveness.

- `AdminLayout.js`: Main wrapper for all admin pages (sidebar, topbar, content).
- `Sidebar.js`: Navigation for all admin sections.
- `Topbar.js`: Header with user info, dark mode, and notifications.

Extend this folder with:

- Table, Form, Modal, Card, Chart components as needed.
- Custom hooks for data fetching, auth, notifications.

All components use TailwindCSS for styling and support dark mode.
